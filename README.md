# snow_globe

Procedurally generate snow globe static renders and animations. Currently a work in progress, but intended features are:

- Setup a mountain landscape, snow particles and sleds, either interactively via the commandline or via a python script
- Procedurally generate mountain landscapes
- Procedurally generate snowflake shapes
- Procedurally generate sleds
- Simulate falling snowflakes and sleds sledding down hills
- Generate static images at certain timeframes and camera settings
- Generate video output with custom camera trajectory
- Generate interactive ThreeJS visualization

Users can then send any of the generated outputs to their friends and family for a unique christmas greeting.
